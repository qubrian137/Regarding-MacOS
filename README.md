# Regarding-MacOS
This is a cross-platform software for macOS and iOS. I will develop it using SwiftUI. As of February 15, 2026, the latest version is Pro 3.1. Here are the main update records:
2026/2/12: v1.2.0 - Optimized login interface;
2026/2/13: v1.2.1 - Improved multi-device compatibility;
2026/2/14: v1.3.0 - Removed login interface; v1.3.1 - Optimized main page; v1.3.2 - Improved task module;
2026/2/14: Pro 3 (based on the stable branch of v1.3 series) - Fixed the issue of inaccurate display on the main page;
2026/2/15: Pro 3.1 - Resolved historical遗留 issues.
During development, I use Codex to assist in code generation (Note: Antigravity might be a typo, please confirm the tool name), and build the front-end interface using SwiftUI.
It is planned to launch a compatible version for iOS and macOS on February 21, 2026 (Beta 1.0, based on Pro 3.1); Additionally, due to exploring the possibility of cross-platform (such as support for multiple systems), a multi-platform compatible Beta 3.2.1 version will be released on March 29, 2026. Please stay tuned！
