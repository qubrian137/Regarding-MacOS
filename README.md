# Regarding-MacOS
This is a software for macOS.

I will develop it using SwiftUI.

The latest update version available: Pro 3.1. Now, I will show all the updates up to 2026.2.15.

2026/2/14 Pro 3 version Fixed problem of unrealistic main page

2026/2/15 Pro 3.1 version Fixed historical issues

To create this software, I utilized Antigravity and Codex to achieve the result.

In the front end, I used Swift to create.

However, this software is specifically for the iOS system.

I plan to convert the software from the iOS system to the iOS and macOS compatible version (Beta 1.9 version) on February 21, 2026.

"Dart" is a language that can run on various operating systems including Android and iOS. However, Swift can only be used by Apple. Therefore, I updated the version to 2026/3/29 (beta 3.2.1).

Please stay tuned!
